# json2csv
A Python script to convert the exported Bitwarden json file into a csv format.

I was having issues importing the default csv file that Bitwarden provided into KeePassXC, so I decided to write my own tool to handle this. Sure, I could have used Pandas or another module to handle this in a far more simple fashion, but this is more of a learning experience for myself.
